#Possible implementation of object orientation approach

"""
For each Team object created a League object is created if necessary. There should be no need to manually
create a league object (don't do it!).

If a team's League object already exists, the team object is simply added to the existing League object's
team dictionary and the League object is added to the Team's league dictionary.

The League and Team classes have registry dictionaries holding links to all instantiated objects.

This means that each object is iterable and all data can be accessed via loops rather than direct calls.
